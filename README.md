The Aim of my work will focus on the following;

Explain the concept of a relational database
Show illustrations on flat file, entity, attribute, primary key, foreign key, secondary key, entity relationship modelling, referential integrity
Produce an entity relationship model for a simple scenario involving multiple entities 

The work I have carried out here will be covering on the following;
-The concept of DB
-Creating DB on Mysql
-How to create an Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagram
-How to assign a Primary key

In the attached word documents, i have worked you through how i created a DB on Mysql. The steps were also depicted in the attached word documents. I executed series of commands to run the command from the sql_store DB as specified. I went through these steps to be able to create an EER diagram. 

I executed series of commands to run the command from the sql_store DB as specified. On the DB on Access, I have entered some data manually and assigned primary keys for the tables mentioned. So basically, a primary key is like and ID which shows the linkage a product may have amongst other products in different tables.

I createed one-to-many relationship between tblCustomer and tblSubscription, and the one-to-many relationship between tblSubscription and tblProduct
